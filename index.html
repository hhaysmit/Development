<p>Thanksgiving Recipes is an easy website to view family favorite recipes for Thanksgiving. To run the website, download the zip file, install the dependencies, and the start a python server to host the site locally. Once the site is up and running, you can sort through the recipes using the following three filters:</p>

<ol>
<li>Search - the search bar allows you to lookup recipes by name.<br>
</li>
<li>Meals - the meal filter allows to narrow the results to only recipes for appetizers, dinner,  and dessert<br>
</li>
<li>Dietary Restrictions - the dietary restrictions filter allows you to customize the recipes if you have allergies or are vegetarian.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>To create this live filtering site, I used React.js. The page is made up of a Recipe Component, which has list of all of the recipes. The Recipe component has three different states, which determine what recipes are displayed. There's one state for each filter (search, meal, dietary), which tells the Component which filters to apply when it is re-rendered. </p>

<a id="design" class="anchor" href="#design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design</h3>

<p>When designing the site, I decided to keep it very simple so that the focus would be on the recipes and so that users would not get overwhelmed. I chose the bright orange banner color because it was a nice fall color and represented the festivity of Thanksgiving well. In addition, I centered the search bar and placed the filters directly below it so that users would immediately see the filter options. I also made the borders of the recipe boxes change to a darker color when  a user hovers the mouse over them, so that it would be clear they were clickable (although I didnâ€™t implement that functionality).</p>
